# mod tools utils

Python scripts for bo3 mod tools to quickly import lots of images and materials at once, will save loads of time.

## image converter script

install:  `pip3 install Wand, apt-get install libmagickwand-dev`
for windows, requires https://docs.wand-py.org/en/0.4.1/guide/install.html#install-imagemagick-windows to be installed

## Image and material import script

Materials will come default with the "geometry, lit" techset. But choosing another techset will autofill the images in each of the fields where the images exist for that material
